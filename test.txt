You know, so who I am? She should we start there?
Uh, yeah, so I am. I have this very rubbish title that doesn't really say anything. It's director of Innovation and engagement in England and that basically that means that I have got kind of responsibility for operational oversight of youth justice services. And I have heads of region who have geographical patches and have the direct relationships with the services and all our kind of key youth justice partners and the focus of my role is.
To understand how the system is operating, where are the risks and challenges, are there areas of best practice? What are the kind of humps that we can support at a national level to breakthrough in having some of the, you know, discussions, perhaps nationally with courts and CPS and police, et cetera, so?
When you kind of say data, most or almost all of the information that we handle with soft intelligence and it comes from the relationships that we have.
Yeah. Yeah. So it's just masses and masses of carriage of and relationship management and engagement and that will take different forms in different regions depending on what the priorities are in that area and who is.
Kind of most engaged where we might need to be impacting what services are showing as being at risk from the data we receive in from our information and analysis colleagues. And so the picture won't look the same everywhere, but the types of information that we're gathering and how we get them is all soft intelligence based.
So I chair pop and.
Yeah, I'd say and. And what I did with POB, when I kind of got it in this role, is it used to be a board where it looked only at the data and what the data tells us. So it has the key performance indicators and the information and analysis team. So our data colleagues currently do a lot of what I call putting the data in a sausage machine and throwing it out the other end.
To give us kind of rug ratings for performance of each individual youth offending team.
I don't know so.
Yes, so there's.
There's 154 different youth offending services across England and Wales and and we will get a rag rating for each of them and for an aggregate, but we'll also get breakdowns against each of the key performance indicators and we will get an understanding of what they're throughput looks like, how many children are coming in, how quickly are there being managed, how do they go out, is there overrepresentation in that cohort or does the ethnic makeup look like?
And and what are the levels of serious violence being seen within that area?
And I think that is the majority of the information. So the key performance indicators and you've probably heard this on repeating stuff, are you use of custody first time entrance and then reoffending which has two measures which is frequency and binary and that combined with the other things that I've just listed is what goes into what we call our kind of POB workbook and the information analysis team.
And do the the number crunching. Kind of they did. The outliers Ragam, Red, green and bar. And what Bob used to do is take a focused look just based on the data and then take action from that. And what I've done over a period of time is say, OK. But they took can only tell us so much. So we need to triangulate some of that with what we actually know about contextualizing that data with what's going on in that local area.
And and so pubs now moved to a bit of a a mixing of. We still get all of the data that are information and analysis colleagues provide us and they still rag rate all our services. But what we're also doing is getting soft intelligence reports from each of our heads of region where they provide a narrative against what's going on with their police engagement. What does that look like over the because we do it quarterly over that quarter period and all the other partners.
And listed but also are there specific things that we need to understand about what might be happening in? Don't know. I'm gonna say a London York cause I live in London and Lewisham. Like do we know? And I don't know that they're currently having mass reorganization at their senior level with changes in which then will impact on the operation of the service and there's no, I suppose real science behind it except that that.
It's a dialogue meeting that that then kind of.
It gives us an opportunity to wade through both what the hard data tells us and what the soft intelligence tells us and to identify.
Where the services that may be, we think are bordering on a bit risky in terms of achieving outcomes for children and do we need to take a more concentrated look to support them and offer them kind of improvement support.
And and also what do we understand when we're looking aggregately as a whole about what the themes are in the system and then moving those forward to how then our kind of other colleagues who have some of those kind of senior stakeholder engagements at a national level are able to use some of that soft intelligence to inform their discussions and to shape policy and to look at how we might be able to impact on procedures etcetera.
Yet they may be they may also be break that down a little bit more. So like for example, what we're seeing currently is a massive kind of kind of stalling of children going through the system because there was a court backlog that was built up during the COVID period. But when we break that down, we understand that actually what's impacting on that is the national referral mechanism and the throughput of children through that. So what can we do with the Home Office to support children getting?
I'm sick like singing more quickly and they're being an understanding of how that impacts on the criminal process, for example. And also we're seeing large numbers of children being released under investigation at the police end, which means they don't get any intervention from a youth justice service because they're not actually received a charge. But they are often being released under investigation for very serious offences and have long periods of which there is.
No kind of outcome as to whether they're getting a charge or not. And then they potentially coming into the system which might see a flooding of people coming in. And so we're also doing some work at actually how do you most effectively use release under investigation for children and how do you make sure you've got protocols in place with that local, you friends and teams so that they know which children have been released under investigation even if they can't do direct work with them at that period in time because no charge has been brought.
So yeah, it becomes more kind of detailed as it were.
Our data set is available, so that's how POB sits.
And in terms of an output of our intelligence, that is the only we're kind of written output that we receive.
In the midst of that, though, there are lots of meetings and conversations, and that informs some of that. And you know, a quarters quite a long time. So then maybe things happening in between that we'll take action on or share etcetera. So becomes like a bit of a spaghetti junction of bits of information.
Yeah. So all the regional heads report into me. So that's how I find out about it. And so we have regular ones, ones we just have team meetings. We also will be asked to contribute to very specific things. So for example.
And our strategy colleagues manage the kind of interface with other government departments. That often means that they're asked to comment on particular areas of policy or operational practice and and they'll seek our input to be able to make an effective commentary on that. So they might.
I'm just going to think about it. So MoJ to to remand review.
For our strategy colleagues to effectively kind of inform that work, they sort intelligence from us about what we understand about how reminders working, what were the barriers to children kind of being able to be released on Community bail rather than going into custodial remand and those in bits of intelligence just came from the constant interactions with services or then going out and asking targeted questions to help to.
Respond to what the query is, so it isn't as neat as to say all the information with comes from one place, because the nature of I suppose and engagement role is that you're talking to lots of people, lots of the time. And the things that you pick up will be very varied.
Well, that's the problem because of the way that we are structured at the moment, this is almost, you know, a little bit of why we know that we needed some kind of central repository because apart from me.
And I can't possibly retain everything that happens across the whole country. There is nobody else that pieces together the different things that might be coming up from different areas of the country and and it's just physically impossible for me to do that in any logical way.
So so my heart is that what we get from Brian, the central brain is a way to be able to have all of that feeling in.
An outputting a kind of insight type report that logically brings a lot of that together.
I think that if we're going to have anything that's like offering like that sounds a bit like a case management system and we're not case managers as it were, and that what we would need to start off with is a very clear framework for what we want our intelligence to pick up rather than a haphazard or I'm gonna put this thing because I had this conversation. It might mean something.
And I think we would need a actually we want one understand about remand. We want to understand about how effectively child centred policing framework is being implemented. We so that there is a.
Clarity for everyone who's inputting about what?
You want to know from them rather than a dumping of, you won't be able to make sense of it.
OK, so this is where I think Brian by itself. Unless someone wants to tell me that computers can do everything won't be able to give a product that I think would be what we ultimately want.
Which is I think that there needs to be a certain amount of kind of human judgment.
So I don't know say we need to provide an overview to the Secretary of State or of course, the picture across the justice system at this moment in time.
For the data will tell us one thing. The soft intelligence will support that and Brian could bring that all together in one. But that's gonna be reins and reams and reams of information. We've got 2 pages.
So then there is a bit of actually, how does a person apply some of their ability to analyze what that information tells them and bring out what is most relevant, and also have in mind political astuteness and how we want to so so they I think.
Having the repository of information with Brian and some sorting and making sense and categorizing is brilliant, and if it can provide reports that give us the picture OK regionally this is what we know is going on in South West. This is what we know is going on in the North West, whatever there is still going to be an element of Brian not being able to deliver what we want for our insights outcome.
We do use wide after look at the data, so the wider S and so all of kind of my team are encouraged to check the YDS for their areas to look at. It kind of service by service to pick out points that enable some of those conversations that they have and to kind of go in there critical friend capacity when they're going to management boards and offer challenge to the partners around the table about what they're doing about what's one of their data might indicate.
And so yes, we do use wire.
And we use Excel in a I suppose receiving information way we're not currently inputting and recording anything from our intelligence into Excel except.
For all serious incident notifications.
Yes. And also but again the numbers there are so small relatively that they're not statistically significant. They don't offer us enough there. It's again still about qualitatively what do we understand about that serious incident and what does that tell us about what maybe is going on across the system. So the numbers are still not high enough for it to be just raw data able to offer us enough.
Mostly all of the other kind of information that.
It's kind of put down is in Word format and and various emails that get pinged around like this.
Yeah, yeah.
Many barriers, one clarity.
And of what? Everyone needs to be recording or pursuing in the intelligence that they're being asked for.
And two people.
I'm gonna say that cause I think people are always our greatest asset, but they can always be our greatest challenge as well. And you know you could come up with this amazing system.
But if people don't use it properly, it's still not gonna gonna work. So I think we've got a bit of a journey and with people and just, you know, different ways of working. And I think historically.
As an area of work, we're so used to working from the place of.
Managing relationships, engagement. Not really. Reporting on what you get out of that. And so there may be a little bit of work to do in, in guessing.
That kind of cycle of actually I get this in and now I need to feed it out so that it needs something to others and not just me.
Yeah, yeah.
And I think.
And this might be a little bit of an aside, but clarity about who's accountable and who needs to have the answers so the system will do so much of that. But can we be clear on who needs to kind of take forward as prose? I'm saying this is quite selfish perspective, but right now.
I almost feel like I'm supposed to know absolutely everything, and it would be quite nice if we're like, OK, so Brian sitting over there, I'm not responsible for Brian. So I'm not responsible for the outputs that Brian is making. I can comment on the inputs, but not the outputs, if that makes sense, yeah.
There are lots of other kind of intelligence streams that are a little bit of kind of outside of just the dialogue that we have that's fit in the portfolio of my team. And you may have heard of some of them. So you've justice plans that we receive annually from services and there's a whole lot of guidance that sits alongside that that says, you know what we want from those plans, there's loads of intelligence there.
There's standards for children in justice, and we honor three yearly basis are services to self audit themselves against how well they are performing and the outcomes that are in each of the standards. So there is a wealth of information there that supports our understanding of the system and then on a kind of also an annual basis connected to our giving of the grant, there are terms and conditions for compliance in receiving that money.
And and so there is then information about whether services are actually doing the things that they are being asked to do to have receipt of that and what does it. And so I can think of at the moment.
Yes, but we are in the we are in the midst of that. So what happens and and this is the first year where we are trying to do it in a much more I suppose.
Analytical way and previously it used to be that those plans come in. They were all read the head of Region, took the lead on understanding what they said and then kind of working with services about the content and how well they then you know, achieve some of the things that they have set out to be in there. But there's far more interest in what is in the plans now and being able to use them to track progress. So for the 1st.
Time properly, we have full kind of analysis spreadsheet. So people have been allocated plans on an individual basis and they are fully kind of inputting their.
Analysis of the plan against each section within that spreadsheet for us to then be able to use that master spreadsheet to draw out some of the themes and issues and understand some key things like.
Where are my Steve Justice Services located in their local authority? Predominantly we know they're in children's services, but there are differences. Who chairs their management board and is that still sitting in the local authority or is it one of the other partners? But other financial contributions coming in apart from what is given to local authorities for the core grant, what do we understand about their priorities? But so, you know, it's loads that all of that information is being kind of.
At the moment, populated service by service, then the work to. Then look at that regionally, nationally England and Wales is yet to come out of it.
She did. She did the power BI dashboard, yes.
To what we're planning to do is you'll know obviously in the middle of a change program and and the end structure that we want to have in place for the beginning of April 2023 will include within my kind of team.
Case holding staff who will have 10 local authority services that they directly engage with and manage compliance and assurance, or in our understanding terms and conditions. Alongside that, we'll be expecting that they use the youth justice plan to track how well they're progressing against what they said they're gonna do in the year.
Yes, we want to do that 100%. We try to do it a little bit already, but because we don't have the breadth of people to know what's going on everywhere.
And it's a bit more difficult to do so, but that's exactly what we would want to be able to do, yes.
Yeah. And also what we've also got right now is we've got one head of region who is managing a number of services from their region and all the partners. And we're gonna add to that by giving them kind of support and stuff to case holder services. So that should also enable us to have better reach of our understanding about what's going on.
I understood our conversation to be for you to get an understanding of what I thought was necessary for the project to kind of deliver, as it were. I think that I've given that to you. You can tell me if I haven't. And for me, what I'd be keen is that what happens next is not a OK, so we've taken all of that. Now we're gonna run with it, but that we have some check-ins to see if the understanding is.
And the fine. And if like the progress being made means that.
What we think we're going to get out of Brian is what we end up getting out of Brian and I suppose what I wanted to stress is that we're talking about something that's not that numbers aren't complicated because they are, but when we're not talking about numbers, I think that increases the complexity of what we're trying to understand.
And and that's what I really want to see.
That we get much better at with whatever this looks like at the end, yeah.
No, that's a good thing. That's literally what I was saying. Don't disappear.
Forget Brian is Cheryl.
Did you have everything that you think you need from me right now?
Yeah. And that's just real difficult thing about it is that and and that's what I was saying about actually, we're always gonna have to apply some judgment to this because the amount of information that we get could be infinite, but actually.
What does it tell us and why is it important? Is what we have to weed through.
Yeah, yeah, I've closed the thing that I didn't mention is what we do at the moment is following every performance oversight board. We pull together a report that goes to our performance committee, which attempts to distill all of that soft intelligence, and it gives a rundown of the activity that we're doing with the services that are our priority services. So we're we're doing improvement work and it kind of breaks down our themes. So in some ways that.
Is the bit of the type of product that would go in to the brain, but there would be so much more alongside it.
That's OK.
No, not right now.
My problem.
Uh, nice to meet you, Simon.
